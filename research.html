      <p>Part of my research deals with nonlinear analysis of operator equations coming from 
applied mathemtics and dynamical systems theory. The computer is a powerful tool for studying 
these equations, and I am especially interested in methods for obtaining mathematically 
rigorous results in collaboration with the computer.  Many of these methods have an 
`a-posteriori' flavor, i.e. first we computer a good numerical approximation and then 
we try to get explicit bounds between the approximate and the true solution.  
In practice this requires a delicate ballance between deliberate numerics and 
pen and paper mathematical analysis. </p></div>




<div class="grid"><strong><a href="#hyperbolic">Computational Dynamics </a></strong><p>
Invariant sets are the fundamental building blocks for understanding dynamical systems. 
The stable and unstable manifolds associated with hyperbolic equilibria and peroidic orbits
of differential equatoins are canonical examples.  I am interested in ``high order'' methods
such as the Parameterization Method
for computing these invariant manifolds. I am also interested in 
methods for numerically studying 
the intersections of these manifolds, as intersections of stable and unstable 
manifolds give rise to connecting orbits between invariant sets.  
These computational methods can be used to study (for example) 
chaotic dynamics, transport phenomena, and Morse homology.</p></div>
    



<div class="grid"><strong><a href="#kam">KAM Theory and Small Divisors</a></strong><p>Many analytic methods
    for studying smooth invariant 
    manifolds are based on the observation that parameterizations of the manifolds satisfy
    certain functional equations. In the case of invariant 
    manifolds associated with a mix of stable and unstable eigendirections the functional
    equations admit the "small divisors" of KAM theory. 
    Studying these equations requires a delicate mix of geometry, number theory, and hard analysis.
    We prove some `a-posteriori' existence theorems 
for symplectic and volume preserving diffeomorphisms.</p></div>
    


<div class="grid"><strong><a href="#numerics">Set Oriented Numerics for Area and Volume Preserving Maps</a></strong><p>Another approach 
to numerical  
discretization of dynamical systems is to represent phase space as a collection of `cells' and then to represent the dynamics as a 
directed graph over these cells/nodes. This is the so called set oriented approach. In this setting combinatorial properties of the 
directed graph provide insight into the underlying dynamics. I have done some work on the application of set oriented methods to 
conservative systems, where the Morse Set/Gradient Set dichotomy breaks down.</p></div>

    <b> Abstract: </b>
  Accurately forecasting a chaotic dynamical system is 
    difficult because even the tiniest uncertainty in its initial state will 
    rapidly compound over time, rendering the future state of the system completely
     unpredictable. This tendency is only exacerbated when certain configurational
      variables are opaque to measurement, a common challenge for real systems 
      in nature. In this paper we focus on chaotic systems whose dynamics 
      irregularly switch between two configurational subspaces of the strange 
      attractor, and we propose a framework for casting these systems as 
      pseudorandom bitstream generators. We then demonstrate, for two such 
      systems (the Lorenz model and Chua's circuit), how cryptanalytic 
      distinguishing functions can be constructed and used to make extremely 
      accurate predictions about the future evolution of their dynamical state. 
      Specifically, we show that, if we are given one bit of the model's 
      coarse-grained, dynamical bitstream and the evaluation of the distinguishing
       function on the interval of the real-time trajectory encoding that bit, 
       then we can predict the next bit of the binary sequence with near certainty; 
       and we can correctly forecast, on average, the next 6-8 bits in a row before 
       making an error.

<b> Abstract: </b>
In this work  
we present a method to find periodic orbits for state-dependent
delay differential equations.
This method is based on a Newton-Kantorovich algorithm and is illustrated
in the case of the one-dimensional Cubic Ikeda Map. 
Though this work is mainly numerical,
the techniques developed are
aimed to be
a-posteriori used in the frame of
computer-assisted proof.
