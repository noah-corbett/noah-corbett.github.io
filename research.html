<p>[1]<b> <FONT COLOR="#ED1B23">Predicting State Switches in Chaotic Dynamical Systems.</FONT> </b>

    <b> Abstract: </b>
  Accurately forecasting a chaotic dynamical system is 
    difficult because even the tiniest uncertainty in its initial state will 
    rapidly compound over time, rendering the future state of the system completely
     unpredictable. This tendency is only exacerbated when certain configurational
      variables are opaque to measurement, a common challenge for real systems 
      in nature. In this paper we focus on chaotic systems whose dynamics 
      irregularly switch between two configurational subspaces of the strange 
      attractor, and we propose a framework for casting these systems as 
      pseudorandom bitstream generators. We then demonstrate, for two such 
      systems (the Lorenz model and Chua's circuit), how cryptanalytic 
      distinguishing functions can be constructed and used to make extremely 
      accurate predictions about the future evolution of their dynamical state. 
      Specifically, we show that, if we are given one bit of the model's 
      coarse-grained, dynamical bitstream and the evaluation of the distinguishing
       function on the interval of the real-time trajectory encoding that bit, 
       then we can predict the next bit of the binary sequence with near certainty; 
       and we can correctly forecast, on average, the next 6-8 bits in a row before 
       making an error.

  <b> <FONT COLOR="#ED1B23">Periodic Orbits for State-Dependent Delay Differential Equations. </FONT> </b>
With V. Naudot.
  <i> Submitted April 2024.</i> 
</p>

<p>
<b> Abstract: </b>
In this work  
we present a method to find periodic orbits for state-dependent
delay differential equations.
This method is based on a Newton-Kantorovich algorithm and is illustrated
in the case of the one-dimensional Cubic Ikeda Map. 
Though this work is mainly numerical,
the techniques developed are
aimed to be
a-posteriori used in the frame of
computer-assisted proof.
