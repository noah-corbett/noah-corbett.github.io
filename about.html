    <!-- <h2>Music</h2> -->
<br>
<br>
Despite what my students may think, I tend to enjoy doing things outside of mathematics. In paritulcar, I enjoy playing and listening to jazz,
drinking copious amounts of coffee, collecting board games, and playing pickleball!
<!-- My fiancée and I have also recently picked up kickboxing (as a means of excercise,
not conflict resolution). -->
<br>
<br>
I would say that my biggest passion lies in music, and I've been playing piano and 
trombone for about 14 years now. Back in 2016-2017, I was the lead trombone player for FAU's Jazz Ensemble under Major Bailey, and in Spring 
2024 I rejoined as lead trombone in the (recently rebranded) FAU Jazz Orchestra under Dr. Courtney Jones.  
<!-- When I'm not playing jazz, I'm usually -->
<!-- on gigs accompanying or being accompanied by my fiancée, who is a piano/strings teacher. -->
