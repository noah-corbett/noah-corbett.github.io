<h3>Florida Atlantic University<br>Department of Mathematics and Statistics</h3>

<ul>
  Hello! I'm a fourth-year doctoral candidate studying computational dynamical systems. My advisors are Jason Mireles-James and Vincent Naudot.

</ul>

<ul>
  My reserach focuses primarily on using techniques from functional analysis to calculate and validate connecting orbits in chaotic dynamical systems.
  In particular, I employ computer-assited proofs to rigorously study nonlinear ordinary differential equations, travelling wave solutions of partial differential equations, and 
  state-dependent delay differential equations.
</ul>

<h3> American Mathematical Society </h3>
<ul> Since Fall 2023, I have been serving as President of the FAU AMS Student Chapter. With the help of the AMS officers and other volunteers from the department,
  we have been able to plan many exciting activities for the department. Our biggest and most recent event of the year, in collaboration with the AWM and SIAM student chapters, was the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/fwimd-2024/home">2024 Florida Women in Math Day.</a>

  <br><br>

  I also co-organize the <b> Graduate Student Seminar </b>  (GSS) along with Juan Miranda. The GSS meets most Fridays at 4:00 PM in SE 215.
  If you are interested in giving a talk, please reach out to me or Juan.
