<!-- <strong>Research interests include:</strong> -->
<ul>
  Hi there! I'm a fourth-year doctoral candidate studying computational dynamical systems. My advisors are Jason Mireles-James and Vincent Naudot.
<!-- <li> Computer-assisted proofs for calculating connecting orbits in chaotic dynamical systems </li> -->

<!-- <li>Reformulation of qualitative questions about nonlinear dynamical systems into quantitative functional equations, and  -->
<!-- numerical methods for studying these functional equations.</li> -->
<!-- <li>Rigorous numerical methods and computer assisted proof in analysis, especially constructive a-posteriori existence (or "shadowing") theorems for invariant manifolds, connecting dynamics, and chaotic motions.</li> -->
</ul>

<ul>
  My reserach focuses primarily on using techniques from functional analysis to calculate and validate connecting orbits in chaotic dynamical systems.
  In particular, I employ computer-assited proofs to rigorously study nonlinear ordinary differential equations, travelling wave solutions of partial differential equations, and 
  state-dependent delay differential equations.
</ul>

<h3> American Mathematical Society </h3>
<ul> Since Fall 2023, I have been serving as President of the FAU AMS Student Chapter. With the help of the AMS officers and other volunteers from the department,
  we have been able to plan many exciting activities for the department. Our biggest and most recent event of the year, in collaboration with the AWM and SIAM student chapters, was the <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/fwimd-2024/home">2024 Florida Women in Math Day.</a>

  <br><br>

  I also co-organize the <b> Graduate Student Seminar </b>  (GSS) along with Juan Miranda. The GSS meets most Fridays at 4:00 PM in SE 215.
  If you are interested in giving a talk, please reach out to me or Juan. 
  
</ul>

<!-- <b> Seminars: </b>

With J.P. Lessard and J.B. van den Berg I am a co-founder and co-organizer of the weekly online 
CRM Computer-assisted mathematical proofs in nonlinear analysis seminar.
