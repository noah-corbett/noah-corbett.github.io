<h1>Teaching Experience: </h1>

As a graduate student at FAU, I've been generously given many opportunities to teach
undergraduate math courses. I believe that teaching is just as important as research,
and it's one of my favorite parts of the job! Below is an outline of the courses I've taught:

<h2> As Instructor of Record</h2>
<ul><li>MAP 3305 Engineering Mathematics 1 (Fall 2024, Fall 2022, Spring 2022) </li></ul>
<ul><li>MAS 2103 Matrix Theory (Spring 2024) </li></ul>
<ul><li>MAC 2312 Calculus w/ Analytic Geometry 2 (Fall 2023, Spring 2023) </li></ul>
<ul><li>MAC 1105 College Algebra (Fall 2021) </li></ul>
<ul><li>STA 2023 Introductory Statistics (Spring 2020) </li></ul>
<ul>
      <li>MAC 2233 Methods of Calculus (Fall 2019) </li>
</ul>

<h2>As Teaching Assistant or Embedded Tutor</h2>
<ul><li>MAS 2103 Matrix Theory (Summer 2024) </li></ul>
<ul><li>MAD 3400 Numerical Methods (Fall 2023) </li></ul>
<ul><li>MAD 2104 Discrete Mathematics (Summer 2022) </li></ul>
<ul><li>STA 3100 Computational Statistics (Spring 2021)  </li></ul>

<h1> Supplemental Course Material: </h1>

While I don't have lecture notes for my courses, I have made some pieces of course material that some students may find useful.
In particular, I've compiled some of my favorite extra credit questions here, and have uploaded some final exam reviews/practice exams. 
For students who are looking for some extra practice, there may be some good problems here, but just note that these documents were tailor-made for my courses.

<ul><li> E-Math/Diff. Eq.: <a href="docs/MAP_3305_002_Final_Exam_Review-2.pdf">Final Exam Review</a> </li></ul>

<ul><li> Matrix Theory: <a href="docs/MAS_2103_001_Practice_Exam_1-2.pdf">Practice Exam 1</a>,
  <a href="docs/MAS_2103_001_Practice_Exam_2-2.pdf">Practice Exam 2</a>,
  <a href="docs/MAS_2103_001_Practice_Final_Exam-2.pdf">Practice Final Exam</a></li></ul>

<ul><li> Methods of Calculus (Business): <a href="docs/MAC2233_Final_Review.pdf">Final Exam Review</a> </li></ul>



<h1> Tutoring Experience: </h1>

I am also a CRLA Level 3 certified mathematics tutor with over 8 years of experience. I've tutored every course in
FAU's undergraduate math curriculum, several graduate-level math courses, as well as undergraduate/graduate courses in other disciplines,
such as engineering, computer science, statistics, etc, at FAU's <a href = "https://www.fau.edu/mlc/">Math Learning Center</a>. I believe tutoring is an undervalued subdiscipline of teaching
and requires skills that one does not get from just teaching in the classroom. In particular, a tutor's role is to teach
students how to become independent learners, not just to teach a subject's content.
